    Detour 09 scoring system

    Soloer gets 110.
    Otherwise, players get 1 per centre held, plus 2 points if they hold any centres,
    If there's a single board topper, that player get points equal to the difference between their
    centre count and that of the player(s) immediately behind them.
    Leader gets 4 points, 2nd gets 3, 3rd gets 2 and 4th gets 1. If players are tied for
    position, they all get the lower position points.
    Finally, scores for a game without a solo are normalised to be out of 100.
    Eliminated players and those who lose to a solo get 0.25 points per year of survival,
    to a maximum of 2 points. A year of survival is when the player has at least 1 centre during
    winter and no other player has 18 or more.
