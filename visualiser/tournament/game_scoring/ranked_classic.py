    Ranked Classic scoring system

    Games that end by draw vote or timing out score as follows:
     - Players score 10 points per supply center.
     - Eliminated players get 1 point for every year survived.
     - Surviving players get a 30 point survival bonus.
     - Surviving players are ranked by their ending supply center count
       and score a ranking bonus as follows:
         7th: 10 points
         6th: 20 points (15 if tied by 2 players)
         5th: 30 points (25 if tied by 2 players)
         4th: 40 points (35 if tied by 2 players)
         3rd: 60 points (50 if tied by 2 players)
         2nd: 90 points (70 if tied by 2 players)
         1st: 200 points (135 if tied by 2 players)
       If there is a tie for a particular rank between three or more players,
       those players receive the score for the lower of the rankings (i.e.,
       in a 3-way tie for 1st place, those players are all ranked third; in
       a 4-way tie for 4th, those players are ranked seventh, etc).
    Games that end in solos score as follows:
     - The soloing player gets 550 points.
     - All other players get 1 point for every year survived.
