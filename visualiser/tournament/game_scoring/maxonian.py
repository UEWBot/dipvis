    Players are ranked by supply centre count.

    If two players are tied, their SC counts in previous years
    are compared, and the player who most recently was ahead gets
    the higher score.
    If two players had the same supply centre count every year,
    they each score the average of their place and the place below.

    point per SC above that threshold, unless the game was soloed,
