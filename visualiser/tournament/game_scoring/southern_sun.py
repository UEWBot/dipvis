    Southern Sun scoring system

    In a draw: 30 points for surviving players at the end of the game,
    10 points per centre, then ranking points based on the Fibonacci sequence:
    7th - 10 points
    6th - 10 points
    5th - 20 points
    4th - 30 points
    3rd - 50 points
    2nd - 80 points
    1st - 130 points.

    Players on an equal number of centres share the average of their ranks
    (rounded to the nearest whole number, where relevant). e.g. Duo board top
    is (130+80)/2 = 105 points each, three way share for 2nd behind a sole board
    top is (80+50+30)/3 = 53 points each, etc.

    Eliminated players receive 3 points per game year played; no place bonus.

    In a solo: Winner receives 500 points; all other players receive zero points.
