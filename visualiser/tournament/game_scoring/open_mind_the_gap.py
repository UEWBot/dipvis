    Open Mind the Gap (OMG) Scoring system

    a) Each supply center (SC) is worth 1.5 points (total = 51 points)
    b) Surviving in a draw is worth 9 points (average = 40.5 points per game)
    c) Bonuses for the Top 3: 4.5 points for 1st, 3 points for 2nd, 1.5 points for 3rd.
       If positions are tied, position points are shared between powers
       (e.g. a 2-way tie for second awards each player (3 + 1.5) / 2 = 2.25 points.
    d) Tribute paid to the board topper is equal to 1st place SCs - 2nd place SCs,
       capped at 50% of a players score from a, b, and c
    e) a solo victory is worth 100 points, with others scoring zero.
