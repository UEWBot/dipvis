To enter or update your preferences, go to the following web page:

Note 1: this address is unique to you - if you share it with anyone, they will be able to change your preferences!
Note 2: you will get a "Page Not Found" error before the tournament starts.

Enter your preferences as a simple list of power letters, e.g. "FTERGAI".
The first power listed is your first preference, the second is your second choice, and so on.
If you enter fewer than 7 powers, any omitted powers will be prioritised equal last.
You can change your preference list at any time.
The list at the time of board call for each round is the one that will be used for that round.
