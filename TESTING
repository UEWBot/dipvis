To run all the unit tests:
$ cd visualiser
$ python3 ./manage.py test

Note that some of the board seeding tests have some randomness and so may occasionally fail.
Also some tests involve parsing websites, so they can fail if those sites have issues.
Those tests should all have an appropriate tag (wdd, backstabbr, or webdip) so they can be
skipped if there are known issues with those sites.

To run a particular subset:
$ cd visualiser
$ python3 ./manage.py test tournament.<test package name>
e.g.
$ python3 ./manage.py test tournament.test_game_seeder

To run all tests except those with the 'wdd' tag:
$ python3 ./manage.py test --exclude-tag wdd

To generate test coverage information:
$ cd visualiser
$ coverage run --source='.' --branch ./manage.py test
$ coverage html
results will be generated in htmlcov/index.html
