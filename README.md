# Diplomacy Tournament Visualiser

Inspired by the TV coverage for sports events, Dipvis was originally designed to
provide something analagous for Diplomacy tournaments. The goal of Dipvis is to
allow spectators (and players) to follow the tournament. However, Dipvis has evolved 
beyond to be a Tournament Director aid - seeding boards, scoring tournaments,
etc. The live tracking of scores is also used a lot by players at tournaments.

This project has been used for several tournaments already at https://diplomacytv.com/

This project was created using [python](https://www.python.org/) code, HTML, 
and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) templates.

You can:
- create tournaments, consisting of a numer of rounds 
- add players to games
- track game, round, and tournament progress. 

Dipvis will automatically generate "commentary" on things related to player history
and can read from the World Diplomacy Database if given:
- appropriate player id
- tournament history
- game progress

When viewing a tournament, the window can be subdivided into frames and each 
frame can show an aspect of a game, round, or tournament.
